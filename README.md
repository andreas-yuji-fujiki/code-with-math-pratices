# 🧑🏽‍💻 🧮 Code and Math Practices

This repository contains exercises and projects where I translate mathematical concepts and steps into code, using different programming languages and technologies. The goal is to learn and explore math fundamentals while practicing programming.

Each folder contains a specific practice with its own project and code that can be run independently.
